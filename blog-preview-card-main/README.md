## Overview
This is a project that I really enjoyed doing. I really liked doing the ':hover' in all of the elements I considered important and I would like to do a challenge like this in the future.

## My process
I first started labeling all of the elements that were in the HTML so that I could recognize and organize them more easily. Then, I created my stylesheet along with a normalize file. Then I worked on the box and learned from my mistakes from the last exercise I did (the QR one), worked on the overall design of the card and then on the hover actions. I felt really satisfied with the result.

### Built with

- VSCode (for writing code)

### What I learned
I learned that with enough practice and learning more, you can develop certain abilities that can help you with these kinds of projects. I also learned that you can transition font sizes.

```css
.font-size-change {
  font-size: 16px;
  transition: font-size .5s ease 0s;
}
.font-size-change {
  font-size: 20px
}
```
### Continued development
I will work on more of these projects to delevop my web developing skills.
